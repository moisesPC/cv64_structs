# Castlevania (Nintendo 64) - Data structures

Definitions for several data structures from Castlevania (Nintendo 64), as C headers.

`extern.ld` contains the addresses (USA v1.0) of all extern'd data. This file is formatted so that it can be included in a linker script.

Useful for mods created in C, as well as for decompilation.
